"""Plotting referendum results in pandas.

In short, we want to make beautiful map to report results of a referendum. In
some way, we would like to depict results with something similar to the maps
that you can find here:
https://github.com/x-datascience-datacamp/datacamp-assignment-pandas/blob/main/example_map.png

To do that, you will load the data as pandas.DataFrame, merge the info and
aggregate them by regions and finally plot them on a map using `geopandas`.
